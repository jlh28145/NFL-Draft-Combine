Purpose - How accurately can draft position be predicted with just combine data and measureables

Problem - Can draft picks be predicted from combine and measureable data for incoming players?

Solution - Will create a classification(draft round) and regression model (draft pick)

Desired Outcome - Finding the limitations of the data source and seeing if past performance of the players is needed to improve accuracy.

Motivations - Grow data science skills while researching nfl stats. Will check against 2024 draft for accuracy.
